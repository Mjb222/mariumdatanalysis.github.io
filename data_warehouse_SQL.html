          <!-- ===== PROJECT OVERVIEW ===== -->
          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This project implements a SQL-based data warehouse using a Medallion
            architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to integrate CRM and ERP CSV
            files into a single analytics-ready environment. The warehouse
            supports customer and sales analysis, from raw data ingestion all
            the way to Tableau dashboards built on top of a star-schema sales
            data mart.
          </p>

          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <p>
            - Integrate CRM and ERP data into a centralized warehouse.<br />
            - Apply Medallion design with clearly separated Bronze, Silver, and
            Gold layers.<br />
            - Design a star-schema sales data mart for self-service analytics.<br />
            - Build a customer-focused analytics view with value and recency
            metrics.<br />
            - Deliver dashboards that surface sales trends and customer
            segments.
          </p>

          <!-- ===== PROJECT PLANNING (NOTION) ===== -->
          <h2>Project Planning in Notion</h2>
          <p>
            I used Notion to break the project into tasks such as requirement
            gathering, data exploration, data modeling, SQL development, quality
            checks, and dashboard design. Kanban-style boards and checklists
            helped me track each layer (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and the
            dependencies between them.
          </p>

          </div>

          <!-- ===== ARCHITECTURE & FLOWS ===== -->
          <h2>Data Architecture and Flow</h2>
          <p>
            The warehouse ingests CSV files from CRM and ERP systems into a
            Bronze layer, standardizes and enriches them in the Silver layer,
            and exposes business-ready data in the Gold layer. The following
            diagrams show the high-level flow, the layer responsibilities, and
            the final star-schema design of the sales data mart.
          </p>

          <!-- FLOW DIAGRAM 1: TABLE-LEVEL DATA FLOW -->
          <h3>Data Flow Diagram</h3>
          <p>
            This diagram illustrates how each source table from CRM and ERP
            flows into Bronze, is copied into Silver, and then contributes to
            Gold-layer objects such as <code>fact_sales</code>,
            <code>dim_customers</code>, and <code>dim_products</code>.
          </p>

          <!-- FLOW DIAGRAM 2: LAYER RESPONSIBILITIES -->
          <h3>Warehouse Layers and Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            The second diagram summarizes how each layer is used: Bronze stores
            raw tables, Silver stores cleaned and standardized tables, and Gold
            exposes business-ready views built with star-schema and aggregated
            tables. It also highlights load strategies such as batch processing
            and full reloads.

          <!-- FLOW DIAGRAM 3: STAR SCHEMA -->
          <h3>Sales Data Mart (Star Schema)</h3>
          <p>
            The sales data mart follows a classic star schema with one fact
            table and two core dimensions. <code>gold.fact_sales</code>
            contains one row per order line, linked to
            <code>gold.dim_customers</code> and
            <code>gold.dim_products</code> via surrogate keys. This structure
            makes it easy to slice metrics such as revenue and quantity by
            customer attributes (country, age, gender) and product attributes
            (category, subcategory, product line).
          </p>
          <div class="image main">
            <!-- TODO: use Screenshot-2026-02-14-at-14.43.39.jpg -->

              alt="Star schema of sales data mart"
            />
          </div>

          <!-- ===== DATA LAYERS DETAIL ===== -->
          <h2>Bronze Layer – Raw Ingestion</h2>
          <p>
            The Bronze layer stores raw copies of CRM and ERP CSV files. Tables
            mirror the structure of the source systems: CRM sales details,
            customer information, product details, and ERP customers, locations,
            and pricing categories. Only light technical cleaning is applied
            (type casting and obvious null handling), preserving full lineage
            for auditability.
          </p>

          <h2>Silver Layer – Cleaned &amp; Conformed Data</h2>
          <p>
            In the Silver layer, I standardized customer identifiers, cleaned
            text fields, validated dates and numeric values, and ensured that
            all sales records link consistently to customer and product
            entities. This layer contains conformed tables such as unified
            customers, enriched products, and validated sales.
          </p>

          <h2>Gold Layer – Business-Ready Marts</h2>
          <p>
            The Gold layer contains the star-schema sales data mart and
            business-friendly views. Key objects include
            <code>dim_customers</code>, <code>dim_products</code>,
            <code>dim_date</code>, and <code>fact_sales</code>, as well as a
            customer analytics view that aggregates customer-level metrics used
            in dashboards.
          </p>

          <!-- ===== CUSTOMER ANALYTICS VIEW ===== -->
          <h2>Customer Analytics View</h2>
          <p>
            I created a dedicated view that aggregates customer performance and
            behavior using the Gold layer. For each customer, the view reports
            total orders, total sales, quantity purchased, number of distinct
            products, recency (days since last order), lifespan (days between
            first and last order), average order value, and average monthly
            spend. Customers are then grouped into segments such as VIP,
            Regular, or Occasional based on revenue thresholds, and can also be
            analyzed by age_group and geographic attributes.
          </p>

              alt="SQL view for customer analytics"
            />
          </div>

          <!-- ===== SALES TRENDS & CUMULATIVE ANALYSIS ===== -->
          <h2>Sales Trends and Cumulative Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            To understand long-term performance, I aggregated sales by year and
            computed cumulative running totals and a moving average over time.
            This provides a smooth view of revenue growth and helps separate
            structural trends from short-term fluctuations.
          </p>

          <!-- OPTIONAL: screenshot of exported CSV or SQL query -->
          <div class="image main">
            <!-- TODO: replace with screenshot of yearly sales query or CSV -->

              alt="Yearly and cumulative sales analysis in SQL"
            />
          </div>

          <!-- ===== DASHBOARDS ===== -->
          <h2>Dashboards and Visualizations</h2>
          <p>
            I connected Tableau directly to the Gold schema to build interactive
            dashboards. The customer overview dashboard includes KPIs, segment
            distributions, age-group breakdowns, and a recency vs. revenue
            scatter plot. A separate view visualizes yearly sales with bars for
            annual totals and lines for cumulative revenue and moving-average
            trends.
          </p>

          <div class="image main">
            <!-- TODO: customer dashboard screenshot -->

              alt="Customer analytics Tableau dashboard"
            />
          </div>

          <div class="image main">
            <!-- TODO: cumulative sales dashboard screenshot -->
            <img
              src="images/dw_tableau_cumulative.png"
              alt="Cumulative sales Tableau dashboard"
            />
          </div>

          <!-- ===== GOVERNANCE & IMPACT ===== -->
          <h2>Data Quality and Governance</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout the pipeline, I implemented checks for missing or invalid
            dates, negative quantities or prices, and duplicate customer
            records. All Silver and Gold tables include load timestamps so data
            freshness can be monitored. Business rules for segmentation and
            filtering are documented alongside the SQL scripts, supporting
            transparency and reproducibility.
          </p>

          <h2>Project Impact and Applications</h2>
          <p>
            This project demonstrates an end-to-end data warehousing workflow:
            from planning in Notion and modeling with draw.io to implementing
            SQL transformations and building dashboards. It shows how structured
            layers and a star schema make it easier for business users to
            explore customer value, product performance, and sales trends
            without needing to understand the complexity of the raw source
            systems.
          </p>

          <h2>Deliverables</h2>
          <p>

            layers.<br />
