          <!-- 1. Project Context and Goals -->
          <h2>1. Project Context and Goals</h2>
          <p>
            This project extends a previously built SQL data warehouse by
            focusing on advanced analytics directly in the database layer. The
            core model is a star schema with a central
            <code>fact_sales</code> table and supporting dimensions such as
            <code>dim_customers</code> and <code>dim_products</code>, all
            exposed through a curated Gold schema. On top of this, I designed a
            series of analytical queries that evaluate business performance
            across time, products, categories, and customer segments, without
            relying on external BI tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each analysis block is tied to real stakeholder questions like “How
            is revenue trending?”, “Which products are over‑ or
            under‑performing?”, and “Who are our VIP customers?”. The emphasis
            is on SQL that is both interpretable for non‑technical audiences and
            flexible enough to power dashboards and data products.
          </p>

          <!-- 2. Data and Methodological Approach -->
          <h2>2. Data and Methodological Approach</h2>
          <p>
            All analyses run in the <code>datawarehouse</code> database using
            only Gold‑layer tables, ensuring consistent business logic and
            standardized measures. Working at this level means that upstream
            cleaning and modeling have already been applied, so the SQL focuses
            on analytics rather than data wrangling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Methodologically, the project relies on aggregations and
            <code>GROUP BY</code> for summarizing sales by time, category, and
            segment; window functions for cumulative metrics, moving averages,
            and year‑over‑year comparisons; CTEs to keep multi‑step logic
            readable; and <code>CASE</code> expressions to define price bands
            and customer segments that can directly drive business decisions.
          </p>

          <!-- 3. Time-Series and Trend Analysis -->
          <h2>3. Time‑Series and Trend Analysis</h2>

          <h3>3.1 Monthly Sales Dynamics</h3>
          <p>
            The first analysis explores monthly sales dynamics at a year‑month
            level. By aggregating revenue, quantity, and distinct active
            customers, I create a time series that reveals seasonality, peak
            periods, and shifts in the underlying growth drivers (more
            customers, larger baskets, or both).
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot: monthly trends -->
          <div class="image main">
            <img
              src="images/A-2.png"
              alt="Line charts of monthly revenue, volume, and active customers"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Visualizing this output highlights seasonal peaks and also acts as a
            data‑quality check: any gaps or anomalies in the time axis become
            immediately visible when plotted, making it easier to catch missing
            data or integration issues early.
          </p>

          <h3>3.2 Cumulative Revenue and Moving Averages</h3>
          <p>
            To obtain a more strategic view, I roll sales up to the yearly level
            and compute a running cumulative total and a moving average using
            window functions. The cumulative measure shows how much revenue has
            been generated over the entire observed period, while the moving
            average smooths year‑to‑year volatility.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot: yearly + cumulative / moving average -->
          <div class="image main">
            <img
              src="images/A-2.png"
              alt="Bar and line charts for yearly totals, cumulative revenue, and moving averages"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Together, these metrics help answer questions like “Is our growth
            accelerating or flattening?” and “How resilient is revenue to
            short‑term shocks?”, and are ideal inputs for dashboards that
            combine bars for yearly totals with lines for cumulative and
            smoothed trends.
          </p>

          <!-- 4. Product-Level Performance Analysis -->
          <h2>4. Product‑Level Performance Analysis</h2>

          <h3>4.1 Comparing Products to Their Historical Baseline</h3>
          <p>
            At the product level, I compute yearly sales per product and then
            compare each product‑year to its own historical average annual
            sales. This classification labels each product‑year as “Above Avg”,
            “Below Avg”, or “Avg”, which makes it easy to identify consistently
            strong performers and items that are drifting downward relative to
            their past.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot: product vs baseline -->
          <div class="image main">
            <img
              src="images/A-3.png"
              alt="Table or chart showing product performance vs. historical baseline"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            For portfolio managers, this view is more meaningful than a single
            global benchmark because it respects each product’s own history and
            context, highlighting where intervention or further investigation is
            needed.
          </p>

          <h3>4.2 Year‑over‑Year Growth and Decline</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to the historical baseline, I compute year‑over‑year
            changes using window functions that bring in the previous year’s
            sales per product. This produces both absolute and percentage
            change, along with labels such as “Increase”, “Decrease”, and “No
            change”.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot: YoY product changes -->
          <div class="image main">
            <img
              src="images/A-4.png"
              alt="Heatmap or table showing product year-over-year changes"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            This perspective highlights turning points in product performance:
            historically strong products that show a recent “Decrease” warrant
            attention, while sudden “Increase” cases can be analyzed for
            positive levers such as successful campaigns or packaging changes.
          </p>

          <!-- 5. Category Contribution -->
          <h2>5. Category Contribution and Part‑to‑Whole Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            To understand which product lines drive overall revenue, I aggregate
            sales by category and compute both absolute revenue and the
            percentage of total sales. This part‑to‑whole analysis answers
            classic questions like “Which categories are our revenue anchors?”
            and “Do we rely too heavily on a small number of categories?”.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot: category contribution / Pareto -->
          <div class="image main">
            <img
              src="images/A-4.png"
              alt="Pareto-style chart showing category revenue contributions"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            These insights support strategic decisions around assortment,
            marketing budget allocation, and opportunities for diversification or
            rationalization of the catalog.
          </p>

          <!-- 6. Product Segmentation by Price Band -->
          <h2>6. Product Segmentation by Price Band</h2>
          <p>
            Recognizing that price positioning is central to merchandising, I
            segment products into cost bands such as “Below 100”, “100–500”,
            “500–1000”, and “Above 1000”. Counting how many products fall into
            each band reveals whether the catalog is skewed toward low‑priced,
            mid‑range, or premium items.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot: price band segmentation -->
          <div class="image main">
            <img
              src="images/A-5.png"
              alt="Bar chart showing product counts by price band"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            When these bands are combined with sales and margin data, they can
            show whether revenue is dominated by premium or budget items and
            whether the current price mix is aligned with the brand’s
            positioning and target customers.
          </p>

          <!-- 7. Customer Segmentation -->
          <h2>7. Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Insights</h2>

          <h3>7.1 Building Behavioral Features</h3>
          <p>
            For customers, I construct behavioral features by summarizing
            transaction history: total lifetime sales, first and last order
            dates, and a computed lifespan in months. These features capture
            value, tenure, and (with a simple extension) recency, forming the
            basis for richer segmentation and lifetime value analysis.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot: customer feature table -->
          <div class="image main">
            <img
              src="images/A-5.png"
              alt="Table showing customer lifetime value, tenure, and lifespan"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Because these features are computed directly in SQL on the Gold
            layer, they can be reused across multiple analyses and exported into
            modeling pipelines without changing the underlying schema.
          </p>

          <h3>7.2 Segmenting into VIP, Regular, and New</h3>
          <p>
            Using lifetime spending and lifespan, I segment customers into VIP,
            Regular, and New groups. VIPs have at least 12 months of observed
            history and high total spending, Regular customers have similar
            tenure but moderate spending, and New customers have less than 12
            months of activity regardless of spend.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot: VIP / Regular / New segmentation -->
          <div class="image main">
            <img
              src="images/A-6.png"
              alt="Segment-level chart showing VIP, Regular, and New customers and their revenue"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Aggregating counts and revenue per segment transforms raw
            transaction data into directly actionable groups for marketing and
            retention, and provides inputs for churn and upsell propensity
            models.
          </p>

          <!-- 8. Insights and Impact -->
          <h2>8. Insights and Business Impact</h2>
          <p>
            Across these analyses, the SQL patterns provide a clear picture of
            growth and stability over time, portfolio strengths and weaknesses
            at product and category levels, and how concentrated revenue is in
            high‑value customers. Because everything is computed in the
            warehouse, the same logic can power dashboards, ad‑hoc reports, and
            predictive models.
          </p>
          <p>
            For stakeholders and hiring managers, this project demonstrates
            advanced SQL proficiency and, more importantly, the ability to think
            in terms of business questions, design appropriate metrics, and use
            window functions and aggregations to answer those questions cleanly
            and reproducibly.
          </p>

          <!-- 9. Next Steps -->
          <h2>9. Next Steps and Extensions</h2>
          <p>
            Natural extensions include adding recency metrics for full RFM
            scoring, building cohort and retention tables in SQL, combining
            price bands with margin to explore price elasticity, and exporting
            customer and product features for predictive models such as churn or
            upsell propensity. These build directly on the patterns established
            here and further strengthen the data warehouse as a foundation for
            both descriptive and predictive analytics.
